Selecting a research topic is a daunting task. Here are some things to help you think through the process.

Remeber that even though a masters unlike a PhD need not be novel. It should still make a contribution to the field. Here is a quick discussion on the difference between the two.

### Novelty

True novelty, like developing a groundbreaking new algorithm or theoretical framework, is a challenging pursuit, even at the PhD level.  Many seemingly novel ideas have already been explored in some form.  The transition from a Master's, where contribution is key, to a PhD, where novelty is often expected, can be a significant leap.  Having already completed a Master's, you understand the depth of existing research and how difficult it can be to truly break new ground.
This highlights the importance of: Thorough literature review, Creative thinking and Collaboration Mentorship.

> Example: Developing a new type of neural network architecture that significantly outperforms existing models on a specific task.

### Contribution

A Master's thesis is more focused on demonstrating a solid grasp of your field and the ability to conduct rigorous research. The emphasis is on showing you can effectively utilize existing knowledge and tools to generate meaningful results and contribute to the ongoing conversation in your area of study.This is often achieved by advancing the field in some way. This advancement can be achieved through:
1. Applying existing methods to a new dataset or problem domain. This expands the understanding of how these methods perform in different contexts.
2. Improving existing methods. This could involve refining an algorithm, optimizing parameters, or combining techniques in a novel way to achieve better results.
3. Conducting a thorough analysis and evaluation. This could involve comparing different methods, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, or exploring the impact of different factors on performance.
4. Generating new insights from data. Even if the methods used are not novel, the findings themselves can be a valuable contribution.

> Example: Applying a known machine learning model to predict customer churn in a specific industry, analyzing the results, and identifying key factors that contribute to churn.

## Picking a Research Topic

When you think of any topic in data science. The first question has to be:
1. Have you got the data or can you get it?
2. If the data is publicaly available. Has this already been done?
3. If it has already been done. What is my contribution?
